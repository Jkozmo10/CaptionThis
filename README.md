## Overview

### Summary

CaptionThis is a deep learning project aimed at generating descriptive captions for images using Python. The system is accessible through a command-line interface and leverages a large training dataset for improving caption quality.

### Team

The CaptionThis team consists of 6 Cal Poly students. The team members are 
listed below:

## Getting Started

Here is all you need to know to setup this repo on your local machine to start 
developing!

### Setup

1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/Jkozmo10/CaptionThis.git`

### Project Structure

- [TrainingSets](./TrainingSets/) Contains the scripts to scrape images from 
    [Google's Conceputal Captions Data Sets](https://ai.google.com/research/ConceptualCaptions/download)

## Contributing
Here are all of the steps you should follow whenever contributing to this repo!

### Making Changes

1. Before you start making changes, always make sure you're on the main branch, 
then `git pull` to make sure your code is up to date
2. Create a branch with the name relating to the change you will make 
`git checkout -b <name-of-branch>`
3. Make changes to the code

### Commiting Changes

When interacting with Git/GitHub, feel free to use the command line, 
VSCode extension, or Github desktop. These steps assume you have already made 
a branch using `git checkout -b <branch-name>` and you have made all neccessary 
code changes for the provided task.

1. View diffs of each file you changed using the [VSCode Github extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github) 
 or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. `git add .` (to stage all files) or `git add <file-name>` (to stage specific file)
3. `git commit -m " <description>"` or
   `git commit` to get a message prompt
4. `git push -u origin <name-of-branch>`

### Making Pull Requests

1. Go to the Pull Requests tab on [this repo](https://github.com/Jkozmo10/CaptionThis/pulls)
2. Find your PR, and provide a description of your change, steps to test it, and any other notes
3. Link your PR to the corresponding **Issue**
4. Request a reviewer to check your code
5. Once approved, your code is ready to be merged in ðŸŽ‰
